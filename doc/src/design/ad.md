An _Administrative Division_ consists of three descending levels: `State`, `Territory`, and `Municipality`. A theoretical collection of `Territory` is the `Country`.

A `State` is the top level administrative division. For example, this would correlate to countries like Brazil or Australia.

Every `State` has a `Controller` which may be manged by either a human or an AI.

A `Territory` contains resources. It also has a single main city. Control of a `Territory` counts towards domination of a `State`.
